# Chapter 8 Summary: Implementing Web Apps with Spring Boot and Spring MVC

- **Dynamic Web Pages:**
  Modern web applications often feature dynamic pages that can display different content based on various requests.
  Dynamic views rely on data provided by controllers to generate the appropriate content.

- **Template Engines:**
  To facilitate the creation of dynamic pages, Spring applications can use template engines like Thymeleaf. Alternatives
  include Mustache, FreeMarker, and Java Server Pages (JSP). These engines allow the integration of variable data from
  controllers into views.

- **Model and View Integration:**
  Controllers in Spring can use the model class directly as a parameter in action methods. Spring manages the model
  instance based on request attributes, and the model class must have a default constructor for this to work
  effectively.

- **Handling Client Data:**
  Data sent from the client to the server can be received through request parameters or path variables. In
  controllers, `@RequestParam` and `@PathVariable` annotations are used to handle these inputs. Request parameters can
  be optional, whereas path variables should be used for mandatory data.

- **HTTP Methods:**
  HTTP requests are identified by their paths and methods, which indicate the client's intentions:
    - **GET:** Retrieve data without modifying it.
    - **POST:** Add new data to the server.
    - **PUT:** Replace a data record entirely.
    - **PATCH:** Partially update a data record.
    - **DELETE:** Remove data from the server.

- **Form Handling:**
  HTML forms in browsers typically support only HTTP GET and POST methods. To use other methods like DELETE or PUT,
  client-side languages such as JavaScript are required to handle these requests.

Chapter 8 covers the implementation of dynamic web pages in Spring Boot applications, the use of template engines for
view rendering, and the handling of various HTTP methods to manage client-server interactions effectively.
