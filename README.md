# Start Spring Here - Chapter 8: Implementing Web Apps with Spring Boot and Spring MVC

This repository contains code examples from Chapter 8 of the book "Start Spring Here" by Laurenţiu Spilcă. The examples
demonstrate how to implement dynamic web pages in Spring Boot applications using Spring MVC.

## Overview

In Chapter 8, we delve into creating dynamic web pages with Spring Boot and Spring MVC. The chapter covers the use of
template engines like Thymeleaf for rendering dynamic views, handling client data with request parameters and path
variables, and using various HTTP methods to manage client-server interactions. We also discuss how to implement these
features effectively in your web applications.
